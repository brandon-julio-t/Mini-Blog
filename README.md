# mini-blog

A mini project.

## What I Implemented

- Implemented CRUD action
- Uses [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/) to model created from form
- Uses Flash message on CRUD action
- Uses JPA as Database ORM
- Uses [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) as server-side template engine
- Uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to design front-end

## How to Launch

1. `git clone` this repository
1. `cd` into the clonned repository's directory
1. Run `gradlew bootRun` in your terminal
